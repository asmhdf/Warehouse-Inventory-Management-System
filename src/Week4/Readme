Challenge Questions: 

1) Why HashMap for product information?

-Quick lookups by ID (O(1) average complexity).
-Reduces overhead compared to linear search in lists.
-Flexibility in combining with other data structures like TreeMap if needed.

2)Why ArrayList for daily shipments?

-Maintains insertion order.
-Efficient addition at the end (O(1)).
-Easy to iterate in order of arrival.

3)Sorting by both name and ID:

Create a custom comparator:
products.sort(Comparator.comparing(Product::getName).thenComparing(Product::getId));

4)Handling non-unique IDs or timestamps:

Use a List<Product> instead of a HashMap for products if IDs are not unique.
Add a timestamp field to Product and store products in a TreeMap<Long, Product> to automatically sort by timestamps.
